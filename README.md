# Introduction to Machine Learning

This document covers machine learning basics.  The focus is on concepts and general approaches, with demonstration in R, though examples can be found for Python as well.  It has gone through an update in 2018 and serves as the basis for a workshop. [link to doc](http://m-clark.github.io/introduction-to-machine-learning/)

Contents include:

- An introduction to get used to terminology and tie things to common methods
- A focus on concepts, such as regularization and the bias-variance trade-off
- Examples including regularized regression, random forests, neural nets, and more
- An overview of extensions and ties to other methods
