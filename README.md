# introduction-to-machine-learning

Raw files for a document covering machine learning basics.  The focus is on concepts and general approaches, with demonstration in R, though an example or two can be found for Python as well.  It has gone through an update in 2018 and serves as the basis for a workshop. [link to doc](http://m-clark.github.io/introduction-to-machine-learning/)
